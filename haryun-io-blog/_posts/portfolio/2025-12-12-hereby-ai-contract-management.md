An AI-powered contract management platform for end-to-end contract workflows—preparation, review, execution, and post-signing operations—augmented with **OCR + LLM/agent** features. I contributed across **product management** and **development (backend, AI)** in Python.

## Project Overview

Hereby (`https://hereby.me`) is an AI-powered contract management platform built to reduce the friction of contract operations. The product combines a document viewer + structured data + collaboration history, with AI assistance to identify missing fields, extract key terms, and support downstream workflows.

## My Role

- Software Engineer (backend + AI)  
- Product management & execution (requirements → delivery)

## Timeline

- **Dec 2024 - Present**

## Tech Stack

- **Backend / AI**: Python
- **AI**: LLM-based features, agentic workflows
- **Inference**: vLLM (internal inference infrastructure)
- **Document**: OCR + contract processing pipeline

## Key Contributions

### AI Inference Infrastructure (vLLM)

- Built internal LLM inference infrastructure using **vLLM** to support product workloads
- Focused on production constraints: reliability, latency, and operational visibility

### OCR + AI-Based Contract Processing

- Designed and implemented an OCR + AI processing structure to convert contract documents into structured, usable data
- Integrated extraction and validation outputs into product workflows (review and follow-up actions)

### Agentic Contract Workflows

- Implemented agentic workflows that assist contract management tasks (e.g., identifying missing/incorrect fields, guiding users through next steps)
- Iterated on prompt/tooling patterns to fit real product UX and quality expectations

### Product Execution

- Drove execution from requirements to delivery: scoping, milestone planning, and cross-stakeholder alignment
- Connected product needs with implementation details to ship quickly without sacrificing correctness

## Results

- Shipped backend + AI features that improved contract review and operational workflows
- Established a scalable foundation for OCR/LLM-powered contract automation
